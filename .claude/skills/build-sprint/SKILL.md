name: build-sprint
description: Run the autonomous build harness for the Truly Homely menu site. Use when asked to run a sprint, run the harness, build the next feature, or continue building toward the goal. Runs as one long live session; reads agent/STATE.md and loops sprints until the backlog is done.

# Build Sprint

Planner -> Builder -> Evaluator harness. Runs in exactly one mode: a single
long-lived session that loops until the backlog is empty or blocked. The main
session context is the builder. The evaluator and planner ALWAYS run as their
subagents (`.claude/agents/`) so they get fresh context.

## State files

State lives in git so the harness survives context summarization and session restarts.

- `agent/GOAL.md` - north star, human-owned, never edit
- `agent/SPEC.md` - product spec (planner output)
- `agent/BACKLOG.md` - ordered sprints with acceptance criteria
- `agent/STATE.md` - cursor: phase, sprint, attempts, history
- `agent/RUBRIC.md` - evaluator criteria
- `agent/evals/` - verdict reports (markdown committed; `shots/` gitignored)

## The loop

Read `agent/STATE.md`, then repeat until a stop condition:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No `agent/SPEC.md`, no pending sprints, or GOAL.md changed direction | Spawn the `planner` subagent. Commit its output. Continue |
| phase=blocked | Stop. Report the blocked sprint and its verdict to the human |
| Pending sprint, attempts < 2 | ALIGN (once per sprint) then BUILD then EVALUATE (below) |
| Pending sprint, attempts >= 2 | Set phase=blocked, commit state + verdict, stop and notify the human |

Stop conditions: backlog empty (success), a sprint blocks, the human interrupts,
or a required input is missing (e.g. the menu data has not been uploaded yet -
report that and stop). On success, deliver the final report to the human.

## ALIGN then BUILD then EVALUATE

0. **Align** (once per sprint, before any feature code): the planner writes only
   a sprint goal plus DRAFT acceptance criteria. Spawn the `evaluator` subagent
   in criteria-alignment mode (RUBRIC "Criteria alignment"): give it the sprint
   goal, the draft ACs, and pointers to GOAL/SPEC/RUBRIC. It returns the agreed
   ACs: strengthened toward the best outcome for the goal, still
   interaction-verifiable, capped at ~6. Record them in `agent/BACKLOG.md` under
   the sprint (marked "aligned"), save the alignment note to
   `agent/evals/<ts>-sprint-N-criteria.md`, and commit both before building. The
   builder never weakens agreed ACs; if building proves an agreed AC wrong, go
   back through alignment, not around it.
1. **Build**: implement the first pending sprint from `agent/BACKLOG.md` against
   the agreed ACs. Match existing code style. Run `pnpm build` yourself before
   handing off; don't waste evaluator runs on compile errors.
2. **Evaluate**: spawn the `evaluator` subagent in verdict mode. Give it only the
   sprint number and the agreed acceptance criteria. Never include implementation
   notes, reasoning, or diffs. Never grade your own work in the main context. The
   evaluator runs the site with Playwright and judges outcome quality against the
   sprint goal, not just the letter of the ACs.
3. **On PASS**: commit `feat(sprint-N): <summary>`, push. Mark the sprint done in
   BACKLOG, advance STATE (next pending sprint, attempts=0), append a history
   row, commit, push.
4. **On FAIL**: increment attempts in STATE. Fix exactly what the verdict's
   instructions say, then re-evaluate. Do not expand scope while fixing.

## Rules

- One sprint in flight at a time. Never start sprint N+1 while N is unresolved.
- Main only receives PASS work. Failed attempts stay in the working tree.
- Update `agent/STATE.md` and its history table on every transition, including
  failures. The state file is the source of truth if context is lost mid-run.
- Verdict files are append-only history. Never edit or delete old verdicts.
- Infrastructure failures (sandbox, Playwright, network) don't count as sprint
  attempts: retry once, then stop and report.
- Keep per-sprint chat updates to one or two lines; the pushed commits and
  verdicts are the record. Only ping the human when blocked.
